# Class Links Web Scraper

This project relates to a blog post linked [here](https://nate23424533.wordpress.com/2023/01/23/web-scraping-tips/).  

The blog post goes into tips for web scraping.  I used this information to web scrape the git hub links from the Flatiron school curriculum site.  This information is freely available at another website ([Flatiron Open Source](https://flatironopensource.ml/), however, I wanted to get the information in a concise format.  Therefore, I created a web scraper using Selenium to navigate into each phase, capture all of the lesson names and links, and then to navigate into each lesson link and capture any github and/or vimeo video links. 

See the [blog post](https://nate23424533.wordpress.com/2022/12/05/building-a-crypto-trading-dashboard-the-first-steps/) or the related [Jupyter Notebook](blog_2_notebook.ipynb) for further information.
